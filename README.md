# ridebus
Ride the bus is an interactive card guessing game developed using python that runs on the command prompt.
There are four steps to this game, you must guess the first one right in order to move on to the next step and you must restart after every incorrect guess.
* Guess the color of the first card
* Guess whether the second cards value is higher or lower than the first   
* Guess if the 3rd cards value is in between or outside of the first two 
* Guess the suit of the final card
